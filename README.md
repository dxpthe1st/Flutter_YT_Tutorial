# flutter_application_1

My first Flutter tutorial.

## Getting Started

This Project was a tutorial followed on YouTube to get familiar with some of Flutter's widgets and how to use them.
I had some fun, also hit a few snags with depreciated widgets and or widget arguments.
As much as this was a useful tutorial it didn't give me exactly what I wanted from it but it served its purpose and I can take what I've learned into other more indepth tutorials and experiments.

PS this is infinitely more satisfying than writing javascript or java/C#.
